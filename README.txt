Hello! I appreciate the time you're taking to check up on my repository!
These are projects I've worked on over the school year.

The first is a Zombie Apocalypse game with various fun aspects I made in my first semester.

The second is a Number Guessing game I made in my second semester with a teammate.

Check them out in the master branch!
